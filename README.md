Cassava Leaf disease classification project
Plant diseases are a common occurrence on many farms globally and these affect the normal growth and yield of various crops. One of the many crops affected by plant 
diseasesis the cassava crop which is among the main sources of food especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Early detection mechanisms for such cassava diseases are
crucial for ensuring proper crop growth and yield without which the food security of communities that rely on this crop is at the mercy of the diseases. The solution to this problem can be found with the help of Computer vision.
